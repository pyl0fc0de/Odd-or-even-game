# Odd-or-even-game
My project id called "Odd or Even Game " named after a specific game I played with my friends during my childhood.
In this game the user is asked to predict the outcome of the dice rolling as either odd or even . The sum of the outcomes of both the dice can be either odd or even .
If the prediction of the user was same as the outcome then the user gains a point.

When I was 8 years old, this game was quite popular among my schoolmates in India. It was traditionally played using hands. Two or more players would choose either "odd" or "even," then simultaneously show a random number of fingers on one hand. The total number of fingers shown would be added up, and the player who correctly guessed whether the sum was odd or even would win.

I decided to create a digital version of this game that can be played by a single person using dice.I created it mostly as a single person game because it can played at the comfort of your room.
